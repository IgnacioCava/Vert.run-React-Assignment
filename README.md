# Vert.run-React-Assignment
Objective - Create a React application that implements the Redux pattern for managing application state. 

The application will contain two pages (activities and monthly stats) that will utilize the Strava API.

React
https://reactjs.org/

React Redux
https://react-redux.js.org/

Strava API
https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/

(Note: if you don’t use Strava you can create fake manual activities on a user)

Activities page
1. Retrieve a list of recent activities of a Strava user.
2. For each activity show name, date, distance, time and elevation gain.

Monthly Stats page
1. On this page, for each of the past 3 months, show how much has the
Strava user done in terms of distance, time and elevation gain
(aggregated data for the activities of the month).

2. When the user clicks on a month, the application should move to a
page that shows the activities of that month in the same format as the
“Activities page”.
Anything else is up to you.
